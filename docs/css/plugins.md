# Plugins

Since we're a little young still, Bones only has one plugin. We'll be adding more in the future.

You can turn plugins on in your files config (`config/___FILES___.scss`).

## Pygments Syntax Highlighting

If you want to add syntax highlighting to your project, look no further. Well, as long as you're following the markup convention equivalent to [Pygments](http://pygments.org/). If you want to use syntax highlighting, I suggest checking out Pygments.

Currently, Bones only offers the GitHub theme, but I plan to add more in the future.
