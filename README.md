# Bones CSS Framework
Bones is a flexible and responsive CSS framework. Bones is being developed 
to use as a framework for rocktree's web projects.

## Info & Background

### What is it?
It is a flexible and responsive CSS framework. Basically, it is a simple 
set of CSS rules that help you quickly design good-looking projects 
without worrying about all the silly little CSS rules here and there. It 
is similar to <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> 
or <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.

### Documentation?
This framework is in its infancy, and therefore there is not yet any 
documentation to accompany it. As it grows and becomes more developed, 
I'll share documentation.

### Why not just use Bootstrap or Foundation?
Good question. Actually, great question. When I need something, I always 
first look to see if there is something out there that will do <strong>exactly</strong>
what I need it to. In the case of both Bootstrap and Foundation, they 
are built for a wide audience, which means there are a lot of stylings 
that, while they were meant to help most, where not what I was looking for. 
In other words, just to achieve the rocktree look and feel, I was creating 
large stylesheets just to override the styles Bootstrap and Foundation 
had "helped" me create. So I built my own with the intent to keep it super 
simple and easy to use (i.e. way less markup).

### What should I use?
In your case, even though I would love for you to use my product, I would 
highly recommend checking out these resources first. They are well documented 
and well-developed. This framework is not yet documented and is still in its 
infancy. Of course, my goal is to just provide a super simple base, so 
if that's what you're looking for, then this might just be perfect for you.

## Getting Involved
I'd love some help developing and designing if you're interested. Let's talk:
