# Bones CSS Framework

Welcome to Bones!

Bones is a lightweight and flexible framework to help you create great-looking websites right out of the box.

## Background

### What is it?

It's a styling framework -- a set of tools to help you create good, clean websites without much CSS effort. 

It is similar to [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/). So why the heck would I rebuild what's already been done? Well, in short, I found myself spending a lot of time trying to undo some of the styles that come standard with Foundation and Bootstrap. I wanted Bones to be even more stripped-down and simple out of the gate, and leave creating anything fancy to you.

### A Little Baby

Bones is a little baby. As it grows up, it will get better at what it does. But it'll also get fatter. So we're going to strive to keep Bones a healthy, young lad (or lady) by trying to find a balance between flexibility, feature-rich and weight.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the `docs` directory within the repo. A doc site is in development.

## v2.0

We have several features we're looking to add by v2.0, which is already in development. Here's the running list:

* doc site
* templates
* better examples / example site

Of course, there's also a running list of features and functionality to be added to the framework itself.
